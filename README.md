Traffic Patterns Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes traffic patterns using a variety of machine learning models. It explores multiple datasets related to traffic conditions and patterns and applies classification algorithms to predict outcomes based on given features.

The notebook focuses on the following:
- Data preprocessing and exploration.
- Training and testing machine learning models.
- Model evaluation and performance analysis.

Project Structure

 1. Data Preprocessing
The notebook starts with data loading and cleaning procedures. Various techniques are applied, including handling missing values and feature engineering, ensuring the dataset is ready for modeling.

 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to understand the dataset better and visualize important features. This includes:
- Feature distribution analysis.
- Correlation analysis among different features.

 3. Machine Learning Models
Multiple machine learning models are applied to the data, such as:
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Used to predict traffic patterns based on the feature set.
- **Decision Trees**: A decision tree from the Random Forest is visualized to understand its structure.

The notebook also splits the data into training and testing sets and evaluates model performance.

4. Model Evaluation
Key evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are calculated for both the training and testing datasets. Insights from the evaluation reveal potential overfitting, as the model performs perfectly on both sets.

 Files
- `Traffic Patterns.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing all code and results.
- Dataset files (not provided in this README) used for training and testing models.

 Requirements

To run the notebook, the following Python packages are required:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

Install these packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Open the `Traffic Patterns.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
4. Run all the cells to execute the analysis.

 Results

The notebook achieves an accuracy of 1.00 (100%) for both the training and test datasets, suggesting potential overfitting. Further investigation and fine-tuning may be required to improve the model's generalization capability.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to analyze and predict traffic patterns. However, it also highlights challenges such as overfitting and the importance of testing on diverse datasets.
